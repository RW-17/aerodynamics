# aerodynamics
Programs used for the numerical projects of the Aerodynamics course during my third year at ETSIAE.

The first project uses the panel method developed by Katz & Plotkin to determine the aerodynamic coefficients of any given 4 digit NACA airfoil. There are still some things to be added but the results are excellent even with a low number of panels. A comparison with Mark Drela's XFOIL showed very little variations for small angles of attack.
